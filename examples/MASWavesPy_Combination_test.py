"""
Test MASWavesPy combination module

This example covers the use of CombineDCs objects to:
- Initialize a CombineDCs object.
- View the experimental DCs and evaluate the variation in DCs estimates
  with frequency in terms of the coefficient of variation (COV=std/mean).
- Evaluate a compusite dispersion curve for the dataset following the 
  procedure described in Olafsdottir et al. (2018).
- Resample composite experimental dispersion curves.

Input files (prepared):
- Data/Oysand_c_list.txt (Set of elementary dispersion curves, phase velocity values [m/s])
- Data/Oysand_f_list.txt (Set of elementary dispersion curves, frequency values [Hz])

Outputs:
- c_TestSite: Initialized CombineDCs object (type combination.CombineDCs).
- Plot showing the imported experimental dispersion curves and the variation in COV with frequency. 
- Composite dispersion curve, saved to the CombineDCs object c_TestSite.
- Plot showing the composite DC (wavelength domain).
- Resampled composite DC, saved to the CombineDCs object c_TestSite and as variables c_mean, c_low, c_up, and wavelengths.
- Plot showing a resampled composite DC (computed curve resampled at 30 log-spaced points, wavelength domain).
